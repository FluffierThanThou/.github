**Output log**  
<!-- A link to the _complete_ output_log. No offense, but humans are fallible. I'd like the machine to tell me what happened so that I can check what you've told me. If you're running HugsLib you can grab one by pressing Ctrl + F12. -->

**Save game**  
<!-- I'm _super_ lazy, so if you can hand me a save game that I can use to get your mod list and easily reproduce your problem, that increases the chances of a quick fix exponentially. Please zip, rar or otherwise archive the file before uploading to dropbox or a similar service. -->
