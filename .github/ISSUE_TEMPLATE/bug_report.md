3.

**Other mods**  
Are any other mods involved?

**Output log**  
A link to the _complete_ output_log. No offense, but humans are fallible. I'd like the machine to tell me what happened so that I can check what you've told me. If you're running [HugsLib](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962) you can grab one by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>.

**Save game**  
I'm _super_ lazy, so if you can hand me a save game that I can use to get your mod list and easily reproduce your problem, that increases the chances of a quick fix exponentially. Please zip, rar or otherwise archive the file before uploading to dropbox or a similar service.

**Screenshots**  
Sometimes, a picture says more than a thousand words. Seriously though, I need that output_log. Pictures are mostly usefull to highlight UI issues. _If you send me a picture of an error log I'm going to cry!_

**Environment**  
 - OS: [e.g. iOS, Windows 10]
 - 32/64 bits rimworld? (If you don't know, it's probably 64).
 - Steam/DRM-free version?
